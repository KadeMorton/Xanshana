## Open world for MozFest

### Overview
Xenshana is a thought experiment around decentralisation

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralisation):

Can the world be decentralised?

In this parallel dimension, people self-organise into open groups that create art, write code, and even build cities. Their technology runs on consensus and their society is fuelled by data. But data is not just a resource — it’s an extension of individual identity and collective culture. People give informed consent to data gathering and enjoy transparency of use.

Journey to a new world and bring back powerful, resilient technology; explore radical, paradigm-shifting ideas; and take part in cutting-edge discourse. Explore protocols like DAT, IPFS and ActivityPub, alongside ideas such as net neutrality and proof of stake. Experience decentralised platforms like Matrix and Mastodon, and support the equal commons of all.

Let’s discover this wonderland, together.

### Myths and Legends

In the beginning there was the Great Spirit Dzivaguru, who created the Dreaming. The Dreaming is the time out of time, the everywhen and the infinite all. The past is Dreaming, the future is Dreaming, and the present is Dreaming. The Dreaming is all of creation, undifferentiated, infinite and absolute with no boundaries. The Dreaming is the fountain of all learned knowledge, ancestry and decendancy exist as one. At the centre of the dreaming, the great tree, Mujitan, connected the sky with its branches, the land with its trunk, and the depths of the world with its roots. 

From the Dreaming Dzivaguru drew time and place to anchor its creation, humans. Everything we perceive, time and space, is a single dimension of a much vaster Dreaming. With time and place, humans set about travelling across the land creating the world that came to be known as Xenshana. Time and place solidified, creating the world as it exists, or is perceived by people, today. With this solidification, definition between what is and what is not, came duality, a deepening of the gift from Dzivaguru. With duality came hot and cold, light and darkness, life and death. Life is connected to the Dreaming, it flows from the Dreaming at birth and returns to the Dreaming on death. With the combination of time, and the many aspects of duality, the gift deepened further with the seasons and the natural cycles of nature. 

Dzivaguru is represented as an infinite serpent with iridescent rainbow feathers, each patterned with the history of every living creature. Rain and rainbows are connected with Dzivaguru, as the presence of a rainbow is said to represent Dzivaguru moving across the land to tend to creation, often moving on after bringing life giving rain. In its aspect of the rain, Dzivaguru is the creator of all life, and is the creator and transgressor of boundaries, creating the infinite, boundless Dreaming, then time and place, slithering across the land to create rivers, flying through the sky and burrowing underground. In connecting these different realms great tree Mujitan is said to be like Dzivaguru, or some claim that Mujitan is just one aspect of Dzivaguru itself.

There are hundreds of thousands of creation stories across Xenshana. Perhaps due to the influence the Rozwi and then the Unhu Collective enjoyed and the success they’d had exporting their culture across the planet, or perhaps due to something deeper, many creation stories across Xenshana include similar elements to the story of Dzivaguru.

### History

Xenshana is a parallel universe to Earth. Created in more or less the same circumstances, the different eras of Xenshana and Earth run parallel to each other. The continents both took the same shapes and humanity flourished on both planes. Civilisation started to build in the same places and mostly go by the same names. Then, something curious happened.

On Earth, the first Punic War between Rome and Carthage ended in a Roman victory. But on Xenshana, it ended in a stalemate. With this small divergence in history the fate of the two realms became radically divergent. On Xenshana, Rome failed to raise enough money from its citizenry to create the naval fleet it needed to cut off Carthaginian reinforcements to Sicily. The conflict between Carthage and Rome was unsettled, and much like on Earth the second Punic War broke out. However, the histories of the two realms continued to diverge, and on Xenshana the second Punic War ended in a Carthaginian victory when Scipio Africanus was defeated by Hannibal at Zama. With the Roman forces broken Hannibal was able to march on Rome and capture the city, brining Rome under Carthaginian control. The centre of power in the world was North Africa, not Italy as it was on Earth. The Holy Roman Empire never went on to establish settlements across Europe. The British Isles were never Roman colonies on Xenshana, and Europe never became colonial powers.

On Xenshana, the centre of power shifted to Southern Africa as trade enriched the Rozwi Empire, largely untouched by the Mfecane from 1814 to 1840 that engulfed the Southern Africa of Earth. The various southern African tribes of Xenshana were never driven north by colonial settlement. 

In a reversal of Earth’s history, African nations, which were more developed than their European counterparts, took white slaves and colonised large sections of Europe, Asia and the Americas. As wealth and political power settled in the Rozwi Empire, their militarism fell away as the affluent class spread the ideology of Ubuntuism. The Rozwi Empire transitioned to an experimental form of governance called the Unhu Collective and started to reach out to all the nations of the world, popularising Ubuntuism. Slavery was outlawed and all former colonies of the Rozwi Empire were given self-rule. Ubuntuism became known by many different terms across the world but the fundamental principals were adopted in many different corners of the globe, becoming the dominant school of thought on Xenshana. The centre of world power now rests between the continents of Africa and Asia, being seen as the old and the new world, respectively.

#### Ubuntuism
The formalised ideology and economic system that grew from the Bantu philosophical concept of Hunu or Ubuntu is called Ubuntuism. The basic premise of the ideology is that an individual exist in the context of others, or it can be stated as I am because we are. From this premise of humanity existing in the context of others, of the group serving as something greater than the whole, springs many ideas on how the group should be treated, supported, and how the group best works. Ubuntuism draws on strands of socialist, communist, syndicalism and anarchist thought, and is a critique of capitalism. 

For as long as people moved away from purely hunter gatherer lifestyles and needed to trade, there have been notions of ownership and value. Money in some form quickly arrived on the heels of ownership as a way to easily account for and transport value. Ownership is a notion that is detrimental to the group, as it means that some will have and some will not. With money comes economic exploitation of individuals or groups of individuals by others, as the main social activity becomes amass as much money as possible. This is also detrimental to the group, as it places the employer above the employee, the group is no longer cohesive. The fact that another person denies one the basics of food and shelter and demands something from them breeds resentment, further ruining group cohesion. As a way of meeting the needs of the people, the newly formed Unhu Collective created industry groups called syndicates that would run themselves by consensus. The groups would set out their organisational structure however they chose as long as everyone was a part of the process, and certain inalienable rights not be transgressed. A form of universal basic income was instituted so that the people of the Unhu Collective could still buy and trade with other nations. 

It quickly became apparent that some jobs very few people wanted to do, since there was no economic incentive to do them, so the Collective introduced a system to replace the government itself. An overarching union was created that coordinated among the syndicates and was able to draw on people to perform unpopular jobs as and when required, but these jobs are spread among the population and only last for a short period of time. Most didn’t mind being a janitor for one day every few months in return for a system that allowed true self determination and gave everyone a voice. This union, unlike the self organised syndicates, would be composed of people who put themselves forward and who could only serve for a set period of time. As laws were no longer needed they were repealed by the diminishing government, one by one. Syndicates enforced their own rules through social mechanisms that people are free to leave if they so choose. Should someone comit a crime against one of the basic tenants of Ubuntuism, like murder, a robbing of someone’s humanity and a direct blow to the group, the person was exiled rather than imprisoned. 

This economic system supported the ideals of equality and group solidarity. As Ubuntuism flourished the Unhu Collective began to evangelise the idea internationally, through economic treaties, film, literature, poetry, and their scientific and technological breakthroughs. Most of Xenshana today practice Ubuntuism to some extent. 

### Culture

Ubuntuism runs through most of Xenshanan culture, collecting bits and pieces from different cultures as it goes to form a pan national culture that people can choose to identify with if they so choose.

#### Totems
The practice of totems started as part of Bantu culture and carried through to modern day Unhu. As Ubuntuism spread and borders began to break down with the slow dissolution of formalised government, totems spread abroad. Nowadays, many people have totems, which are an animal or potentially a body part like the heart or brain, that is associated with the family. Totems are passed from parents to children and are used as a tool to trace genealogy back to ancestors. People are said to take on aspects of the totem they inherit. 

#### Rite of Passage
In countries that practice Ubuntuism to some degree, it is often that children are not considered adults until they go through a rite of passage called Kutema Li. After the person has served one year in a self-organised syndicate, as recognised by others of the syndicate, the person then will undertake a ceremony in the traditional clothes of their culture and give praise to their ancestors. Depending on the person’s ancestry the contents of Kutema Li can differ. But once Kutema Li has been passed, the person is considered an adult.

#### Reputation
In a society which fundamentally believes humanity exists in the context of the group, reputation is important. For some, it completely replaces currency. Using technology that is worn as jewellery, fashion, or unobtrusively under their clothing, deeds are recorded through images, sounds, spoken word and text entries. These deeds are entered into one or many of the distributed ledgers that Xenshanans use to record their reputation. Others can come to consensus about these deeds to lend them levels of authenticity, and people can choose what elements of this reputation are public and what is shared with who. Deeds that negatively impact others are also captured and vetted through consensus. A person can choose to not display certain parts of their reputation to hide particular deeds, but there is also word of mouth. People can choose to add other things like their totem and ancestry, allowing reputation to become complete representation of self. Reputation is often holographically projected or viewed online, as a complex and rich tapestry outlining the deeds of the person, combining static artwork, video, music and sound. To join a syndicate, people often just submit their reputation for inspection. Legend has it that this artistic representation of a person’s history is captured in the feathers of Dzivaguru, giving the great serpent it’s rainbow coloured feathers.

#### Languages
There are many languages spoken on Xenshana, the trade language being Rozwi (note: a mixture of Shona, Ndebele, Xhosa and Zulu). The second most common language is Guānhuà (Mandarin) spoken by the Zhong Guo Dynasty and many other Asian countries. 
Technology is important to the Rozwi, and the language has been turned into a computer programming language. You can program by talking in Rozwi and following some basic sentence structure to define things like function calls.

#### Greeting
The traditional greeting of the Unhu Collective, which has been taken up across Xenshana, is to cup ones hands and clap. It demonstrates gratitude for the other person and gives thanks to them.

### Technology
In keeping with the notion of Ubuntuism and group ownership, Xenshanans favour decentralised technology, eschewing centralised control or too much control and influence being wielded by one or a small number of parties. Often, particular platforms and networks will be maintained by a syndicate. Another highly valued feature is control of personal data in all form, how the data is generated, where it is stored, who has access to the data along with knowing and giving permission for what the data is used for. These two properties are the social norm for what Xenshanans expect from their technology, if they aren’t present Xenshanans often won’t adopt it in vast numbers. Owning due to the cooperative nature of Xenshana, rather than the competitive nature of Earth, Xenshana has a generally higher level of technology. Almost all technology is open source, allowing for permissionless innovation. Technology is often woven into wearables, feeding into the reputation ledgers and allowing people to holographically project the artwork that is their reputation for others. The internet itself in many areas is truly decentralised with local communities controlling and local syndicates maintaining physical infrastructure and internet service providers. Global social media platforms are decentralised with servers and instances looked after by interested groups. Technological marvels, that seem impossible to the average citizen of Earth are commonplace on Xenshana, like multinational syndicates supporting human space exploration and the Dream.

### The Dream
Data holds a special significance for Xenshanans. Not only can data tell you about a person currently, it can tell you about their past, right through to their ancestry in the case of DNA, and it can make predictions on the future. In this day, data is viewed as a resource with similar properties to the Dreaming itself. A number of syndicates had a grand vision for a world where past and present could come together to define the future, and they set about building a planet wide array of quantum computer networks. Collectively, this decentralised network is called the Dream. Separate from the internet, but connected to it, the Dream stores all data collected about a person. Reputation is backed up to the Dream. All the wearables that Xenshanans use, all that information is stored in the Dream. Medical vitals and even brainwaves are stored in the Dream. This vast collection of data on people, creating copies of people with real history and experiences, sophisticated enough to generate conscious thought, creates beings called Dreamers. Dreamers are separate from people, but they are accorded the same rights as people. 

A year after someone passes away, people practice a ceremony called Kurova Guva, which was intended to recall the spirit of a person from the afterlife to aid the family. This practice still continues in large parts of Africa and abroad, but a new ceremony called Kusvikirwa, based on Kurova Guva, started to be practiced. Dreamers could be brought from the Dream. Some exist solely in electronic networks, others holographically project an avatar as a physical presentation in the world. A Dreamer can be composed of the data from a single person, or can be a composite of the data from many people. Indeed, people often have their data shared by multiple Dreamers. Depending on the technological augmentations an individual chooses to get, they can even share their body with a Dreamer, to become a host to multiple personalities or mixing their individuality with that of the Dreamer to become a new person. Dreamers can participate in syndicates as a normal person, or, possessing their own agency, they can chase their own desires. Dreamers can gather their own reputation and become entirely new identities if they like. As Dreamers can be made up of the experiences of an entire family, or an entire generation people, the advice of Dreamers is often sought after and highly regarded. Dreamers are also considered sacred by some cultures as through a combination of genetic data and shared experience Dreamers represent a tangible connection to someone’s ancestry and, as an extension of humanity, help guide humanity to a bright future.

### Construction

### Food production

### Trade

#### Currency

### Education

### Transport

### Weapons
After the High War between the African Concurrence and Zhong Guo Dynasty, an embargo on weapons research was put into effect globally. Known as the 1952 Embargo on Research into Technology of a Destructive Nature, or just the 1952 Embargo, it froze weapons tech in place so that any future war would, hopefully be less destructive than the last one. It also meant that some people had to find new fields to work in, boosting research and development of technology that the consensus believes to be of social value.
