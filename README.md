### Overview
Xenshana is a thought experiment around decentralisation

### Myths and Legends

In the beginning there was the Great Spirit Dzivaguru, who created the Dreaming. The Dreaming is the time out of time, the everywhen and the infinite all. The past is Dreaming, the future is Dreaming, and the present is Dreaming. The Dreaming is all of creation, undifferentiated, infinite and absolute with no boundaries. The Dreaming is the fountain of all learned knowledge, ancestry and decendancy exist as one. At the centre of the dreaming, the great tree, Mujitan, connected the sky with its branches, the land with its trunk, and the depths of the world with its roots. From the Dreaming Dzivaguru drew time and place to anchor its creation, humans. Everything we perceive, time and space, is a single dimension of a much vaster Dreaming. With time and place, humans set about travelling across the land creating the world that came to be known as Xenshana. Time and place solidified, creating the world as it exists, or is perceived by people, today. With this solidification, definition between what is and what is not, came duality, a deepening of the gift from Dzivaguru. With duality came hot and cold, light and darkness, life and death. Life is connected to the Dreaming, it flows from the Dreaming at birth and returns to the Dreaming on death. With the combination of time, and the many aspects of duality, the gift deepened further with the seasons and the natural cycles of nature. Dzivaguru is represented as an infinite serpent with iridescent rainbow feathers, each patterned with the history of every living creature. Rain and rainbows are connected with Dzivaguru, as the presence of a rainbow is said to represent Dzivaguru moving across the land to tend to creation, often moving on after bringing life giving rain. In its aspect of the rain, Dzivaguru is the creator of all life, and is the creator and transgressor of boundaries, creating the infinite, boundless Dreaming, then time and place, slithering across the land to create rivers, flying through the sky and burrowing underground. In connecting these different realms great tree Mujitan is said to be like Dzivaguru, or some claim that Mujitan is just one aspect of Dzivaguru itself.

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralisation):

Can the world be decentralised?

In this parallel dimension, people self-organise into open groups that create art, write code, and even build cities. Their technology runs on consensus and their society is fuelled by data. But data is not just a resource — it’s an extension of individual identity and collective culture. People give informed consent to data gathering and enjoy transparency of use.

Journey to a new world and bring back powerful, resilient technology; explore radical, paradigm-shifting ideas; and take part in cutting-edge discourse. Explore protocols like DAT, IPFS and ActivityPub, alongside ideas such as net neutrality and proof of stake. Experience decentralised platforms like Matrix and Mastodon, and support the equal commons of all.

Let’s discover this wonderland, together.
