# Xenshana

## Open world for MozFest

### Overview
Xenshana is a thought experiment around decentralisation

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces#Decentralisation):

Can the world be decentralised?

In this parallel dimension, people self-organise into open groups that create art, write code, and even build cities. Their technology runs on consensus and their society is fuelled by data. But data is not just a resource — it’s an extension of individual identity and collective culture. People give informed consent to data gathering and enjoy transparency of use.

Journey to a new world and bring back powerful, resilient technology; explore radical, paradigm-shifting ideas; and take part in cutting-edge discourse. Explore protocols like DAT, IPFS and ActivityPub, alongside ideas such as net neutrality and proof of stake. Experience decentralised platforms like Matrix and Mastodon, and support the equal commons of all.

Let’s discover this wonderland, together.

### Myths and Legends

In the beginning there was the Great Spirit Dzivaguru, who created the Dreaming. The Dreaming is the time out of time, the everywhen and the infinite all. The past is Dreaming, the future is Dreaming, and the present is Dreaming. The Dreaming is all of creation, undifferentiated, infinite and absolute with no boundaries. The Dreaming is the fountain of all learned knowledge, ancestry and decendancy exist as one. At the centre of the dreaming, the great tree, Mujitan, connected the sky with its branches, the land with its trunk, and the depths of the world with its roots. 

From the Dreaming Dzivaguru drew time and place to anchor its creation, humans. Everything we perceive, time and space, is a single dimension of a much vaster Dreaming. With time and place, humans set about travelling across the land creating the world that came to be known as Xenshana. Time and place solidified, creating the world as it exists, or is perceived by people, today. With this solidification, definition between what is and what is not, came duality, a deepening of the gift from Dzivaguru. With duality came hot and cold, light and darkness, life and death. Life is connected to the Dreaming, it flows from the Dreaming at birth and returns to the Dreaming on death. With the combination of time, and the many aspects of duality, the gift deepened further with the seasons and the natural cycles of nature. 

Dzivaguru is represented as an infinite serpent with iridescent rainbow feathers, each patterned with the history of every living creature. Rain and rainbows are connected with Dzivaguru, as the presence of a rainbow is said to represent Dzivaguru moving across the land to tend to creation, often moving on after bringing life giving rain. In its aspect of the rain, Dzivaguru is the creator of all life, and is the creator and transgressor of boundaries, creating the infinite, boundless Dreaming, then time and place, slithering across the land to create rivers, flying through the sky and burrowing underground. In connecting these different realms great tree Mujitan is said to be like Dzivaguru, or some claim that Mujitan is just one aspect of Dzivaguru itself.

There are hundreds of thousands of creation stories across Xenshana. Perhaps due to the influence the Rozwi and then the Unhu Collective enjoyed and the success they’d had exporting their culture across the planet, or perhaps due to something deeper, many creation stories across Xenshana include similar elements to the story of Dzivaguru.

### History

Xenshana is a parallel universe to Earth. Created in more or less the same circumstances, the different eras of Xenshana and Earth run parallel to each other. The continents both took the same shapes and humanity flourished on both planes. Civilisation started to build in the same places and mostly go by the same names. Then, something curious happened.

On Earth, the first Punic War between Rome and Carthage ended in a Roman victory. But on Xenshana, it ended in a stalemate. With this small divergence in history the fate of the two realms became radically divergent. On Xenshana, Rome failed to raise enough money from its citizenry to create the naval fleet it needed to cut off Carthaginian reinforcements to Sicily. The conflict between Carthage and Rome was unsettled, and much like on Earth the second Punic War broke out. However, the histories of the two realms continued to diverge, and on Xenshana the second Punic War ended in a Carthaginian victory when Scipio Africanus was defeated by Hannibal at Zama. With the Roman forces broken Hannibal was able to march on Rome and capture the city, brining Rome under Carthaginian control. The centre of power in the world was North Africa, not Italy as it was on Earth. The Holy Roman Empire never went on to establish settlements across Europe. The British Isles were never Roman colonies on Xenshana, and Europe never became colonial powers.

On Xenshana, the centre of power shifted to Southern Africa as trade enriched the Rozwi Empire, largely untouched by the Mfecane from 1814 to 1840 that engulfed the Southern Africa of Earth. The various southern African tribes of Xenshana were never driven north by colonial settlement. 

In a reversal of Earth’s history, African nations, which were more developed than their European counterparts, took white slaves and colonised large sections of Europe, Asia and the Americas. As wealth and political power settled in the Rozwi Empire, their militarism fell away as the affluent class spread the ideology of Ubuntuism. The Rozwi Empire transitioned to an experimental form of governance called the Unhu Collective and started to reach out to all the nations of the world, popularising Ubuntuism. Slavery was outlawed and all former colonies of the Rozwi Empire were given self-rule. Ubuntuism became known by many different terms across the world but the fundamental principals were adopted in many different corners of the globe, becoming the dominant school of thought on Xenshana. The centre of world power now rests between the continents of Africa and Asia, being seen as the old and the new world, respectively.
